# Takeaways

Something about how this could be similar to the waffle house index but for politics

# Limitations

Talk about how using percentage of democratic votes is valid since the US is largely a 2 party system. However, this does not account for the maximum <5% of votes in a county that are given to 3rd party candidates and could cause problems, since we sort of make the assumption that gop and dem are the only ones that get votes.
